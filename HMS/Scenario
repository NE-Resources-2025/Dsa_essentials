Scenario: Different Hospitals [ex: H1,H2,..] with different distances between them for example between h1 and h2 there's 5km,...
now we want to create a hospital management system that can do CRUD operations on the hospital:
like registering the hospitals like H3 and its details like name,location,number of patients (and any more suggested) and then use csv as DB.
Then there's another CRUD to link the hospitals in the graph and give them the distance between the hospitals and also use csv as DB.

on run i want you to prompt the user to :
1. View the registered Hospitals and their details
2. Add a hospital and its details
3. Update hospital details
4.Delete hospital
5. Link hospital to another hospital means you will input the distance between them
6. View the graph of the hospitals and their edges (graph)
7. Help (find things to put in help for user experience... )
8. Exit

Refer to this graph:
